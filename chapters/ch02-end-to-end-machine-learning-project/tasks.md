## Exersices for Chapter 02

### 1. 
**Q:** Try a Support Vector Machine regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR) with various hyperparameters, such as kernel="linear" (with various values for the C hyperparameter) or kernel="rbf" (with various values for the C and gamma hyperparameters). Don’t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now. How does the best SVR predictor perform?

### 2. 
**Q:** Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.

### 3. 
**Q:** Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most important attributes.

### 4. 
**Q:** Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final prediction.

### 5. 
**Q:** Automatically explore some preparation options using GridSearchCV.
